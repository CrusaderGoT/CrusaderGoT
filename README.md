[outdated,will update soon]

👋 Hi, I’m @CrusaderGoT

- 👤 **Real Name**: Emeka ~ a-may-kah

👀 I’m passionate about **Python**, especially with **Django** for web development, and I enjoy working with various libraries and technologies including:
  - 🎶 **Librosa** for audio and music analysis,
  - 🎥 **Moviepy** for video editing and manipulation,
  - 🔢 **Numpy** and **Scipy** for scientific computing,
  - 🖼️ **PIL** (Python Imaging Library) for image processing,
  - 📊 **Matplotlib** for data visualization,
  - 💻 **HTML** and **CSS** for frontend development,
  - 🅱️ **Bootstrap5** for responsive design.

🌱 Currently, I'm expanding my skills into **JavaScript** and diving deeper into **Django REST framework** for building RESTful APIs. I've also been experimenting with **Tailwind CSS** for modern and utility-first styling, and **Geopy** for geocoding and location-based services.

💡 In my recent ventures, I've explored database management with **PostgreSQL** using **Psycopg2**, deploying applications on platforms like **Render**, and **API Integration**.

🔭 Additionally, some of my personal projects not on GitHub, include an e-commerce website available on sale on Upwork; utilizing APIs from platforms like Reddit, Spotify, Twitter, and Meta for personal use.

🚀 Looking ahead, I aim to delve into cloud technologies like **AWS**, containerization with **Docker**, and dive deeper into **machine learning** (ML) and **artificial intelligence** (AI).
